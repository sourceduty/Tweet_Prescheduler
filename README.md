### Tweet_Prescheduler

üìÖ Organize links and hashtags prescheduled into TweetDeck for Twitter.

#

### CONCEPT

```
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define your tweets with links and hashtags
tweets = [
    {"date": "2023-11-10 10:00", "text": "Check out our new product! #launch #newproduct", "link": "http://example.com/new-product"},
    {"date": "2023-11-11 12:00", "text": "Read our latest blog post. #blog #reading", "link": "http://example.com/blog-post"},
    # Add more tweets as needed
]

# Function to organize tweets
def organize_tweets(tweets):
    # Sort tweets by date
    sorted_tweets = sorted(tweets, key=lambda k: datetime.strptime(k['date'], "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"))
    
    # Prepare CSV data
    csv_data = [["Scheduled Date", "Tweet Text", "Link"]]
    for tweet in sorted_tweets:
        row = [tweet['date'], tweet['text'] + " " + tweet['link']]
        csv_data.append(row)
    
    # Write to CSV file
    with open('scheduled_tweets.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerows(csv_data)
    print("Tweets have been organized and saved to scheduled_tweets.csv")

# Call the function to organize tweets
organize_tweets(tweets)
```

This script will take a list of tweets with their scheduled dates, text, and links, sort them by date, and then write them to a CSV file named scheduled_tweets.csv. You can then use this CSV file to manually schedule your tweets on TweetDeck.

Remember, you'll need to have Python installed on your system to run this script, and you can execute it in any standard Python environment.

If you want to automate the process of scheduling tweets, you would need to use the Twitter API directly, but this would not involve TweetDeck. Automating Twitter interactions through the API requires careful adherence to Twitter's Automation Rules to avoid any potential violations that could lead to account suspension.
